## Part 2: 

Vscode was already installed on my computer but it's not hard to do. You just need to install it from their site then install a few coding languages. For a Windows computer like me, you also have to change several environment variables for the languages you got. In my case it was Java and JUnit.

To remotely connect, you have to first find your corresponding account and reset you password. Then, you go on the terminal and type in `ssh _repository name_` and enter the passcode to sign in. 

## Part 4:
